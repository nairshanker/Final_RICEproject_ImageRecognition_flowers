Final Project- Image Recognition Project- Flowers dataset
10th October 2020

OVERVIEW
This project team is comprised of Brock Kanjicai, Ahmed Lotfy and Shanker Nair. We propose to carry out an image recognition project with a flowers dataset with around 4000 different images of flowers across multiple species/classes.

TASK BREAKDOWN

(I) Machine Learning Model
1.	Use python pandas to create a machine learning model to train the dataset of flowers.
2.	Carry out the necessary tasks to make the model predict the flower category with
	(a) Test dataset; (b) Validation dataset; (b) Test dataset
3.	Generate an api endpoint route for the project
4.	Optional: Recommendation of closest flower based on the current prediction

(II) Creating the front-end API and visulaization
5.	Create a basic HTML/CSS layout to display the project
6.	Create the required routes and JavaScript necessary to connect to the front end

(III) Creating the Heroku connection
7.	Once the app deploys successfully, work on the Heroku deployment. 

(IV) Testing the ML model in the front end
8.	Deploy and test the front end interface with random images of flowers for prediction.
